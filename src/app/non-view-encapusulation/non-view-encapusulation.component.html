<p>non-view-encapusulation works!</p>
<h2>This is none view Encapsulation</h2>

None Encapsulation will also get affected by gobal styling.
<br>
None Encapsulation will let you leak component's styling outside the component, means it will be applied globally.
see here we have used h2 tag whose color is set to purple in component's style file, but it is also affecting the h2 tag in app.component.html.(see how the color is purple for the view Encapsulation now)
